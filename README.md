# Playstore_Dataset
One of the features of Technology is android, which we all use in our daily life. Google Play Store and formerly the Android Market, is a digital distribution service operated and developed by Google. 

It serves as the official app store  allowing users to browse and download applications developed with the Android software development kit (SDK) and published through Google. It provides latest Android apps, games, music etc. 

We need to analyze the Google Play Store Dataset, gather meaningful Insights from it and show the relationships between different attributes.
